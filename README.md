# ‚ôæÔ∏è Open whiteboard initiative

OWBI is an initiative for standartizing the way how digital whiteboards exchange the data.

This is proposal of version üçÇ `1.0.0` created by [Pavol Hejn√Ω](https://pavolhejny.com), co-author of [online whiteboard Collboard](https://collboard.com).
This proposal is implemented with [multiple sample applications](/applications)) during the [HackPrague](https://www.hackprague.com/hackathon2021) hackathon.

# üìù Whitepaper

Our goal is to capture all **essential features of the whiteboards**. Thay at the first glance seem to be simmilar as images or documents but they are definitelly specific.

-   Enable to extend the format with new features specific to each platform but still be able to use some basic common features
-   Support for infinitely large whiteboards
-   Support of both vector and raster graphics
-   Keep information who and when created the board
-   Preserve history
-   Decentralize & distribute storage of the whiteboards

## File for offline use

We describe here `.OWB` file extension as universal whiteboard format.

## API for real-time interaction

We describe here protocol for real-time communication & federation between users and whiteboards.
This is implemented by Socket.io API and [Superface OneSDK](https://superface.ai/).
